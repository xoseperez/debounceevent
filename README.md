## Features

The main features of the DebounceEvent library are:

* Supports push buttons and toggle switches
* Reports # of clicks and length (in millis) of the last click
* Allows to define internal pull-ups
* Isolation between buttons
* Create modular code using callbacks

* Handles resistive/capacitive touch button detection.

## Operation

The touch detection is based on the time it takes for a pin to return to the opposite state when switched from output to input mode.

A touch button can be implemented by simply connecting a resistor between pin and gnd or pin and vdd (set BUTTON_SET_PULLUP) and connecting a piece of conducting material to the pin. These will form an RC network, which determines the decay time. A change to R or C will be detected.

On ESP8266 it has been tested with a 2.2MOhm resistor between pin and ground and a piece of wire connected to the pin.

The routine works by taking a long term average and a short term averahe. WHen the short term average differs significantly from the long term average this is seen as a button press. To determine if the change is significant the variance of the short term averages is calculated; the detection threshold is a configurable multiplier times the variance.

## Usage

See examples.
